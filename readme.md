# First PHP Project

just finished skimming through the whole php docs

In this project a simple form is submitted

the output gets appended to a file and user gets redirected back to the same page

but the page will now have new data from the previouse input

if publicly deployed this could be the most simple public feedback app using vanilla php, html and css

Everything is kept very vanilla

TODOS:

- [ ] make it responsive
